# Koog Documentation

This module contains documentation for the Koog framework, including user guides, API references, prompting guidelines, and other static files.

## Module Structure

The docs module is organized as follows:

| Folder         | Description                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **docs/**      | Contains Markdown files with user documentation.                                     |
| **overrides/** | Contains custom overrides for the MkDocs theme.                                      |
| **prompt/**    | Prompting guidelines with extensions for popular modules.                            |
| **src/**       | Knit generated source code from documentation code snippets, should not be commited. |


## Local Development

To run the documentation website locally, you need to have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

1. Sync the project (this will create proper .venv and install dependencies, no manual Python setup required):
   ```bash
   uv sync --frozen --all-extras
   ```

2. Start the local documentation server:
   ```bash
   uv run mkdocs serve
   ```

The documentation will be available at the URL printed in the output and will automatically reload when you make changes to the documentation files.

## Documentation System

### MkDocs

The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the Material theme. The configuration is defined in `mkdocs.yml`, which specifies:

- Navigation structure
- Theme configuration
- Markdown extensions
- Repository links

The documentation is available at [https://docs.koog.ai/](https://docs.koog.ai/).

### Content Reuse

The Koog documentation sources include content that is reused in multiple places in published documentation. For
example, in the **Provider-specific parameters** section in `llm-parameters.md`, each table row for each provider is a
reusable content snippet that looks similar to the following one: 

```text
--8<--
llm-parameters-snippets.md:heading
llm-parameters-snippets.md:topP
llm-parameters-snippets.md:topK
llm-parameters-snippets.md:thinkingConfig
--8<--
```

To create or update reusable content, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs/snippets` directory. For updates to existing files, navigate to the file
that includes the content snippet you want to update.
2. Add or edit the content snippet. A snippet that includes a block of content has the following structure:
    ```text
    # --8<-- [start:snippetName]
    Snippet content. Can also include **Markdown formatting**.
    # --8<-- [end:snippetName]
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > As this type of content is usually reused in multiple places, note that updates to existing snippets will be
   > reflected in all places where they are used. Before making updates, ensure that the changes are appropriate for
   > all uses of the snippet.
       
3. Reference the content snippet in the documentation source file where you want to use it:
    ```text
    --8<--
    snippet-file-name.md:snippetName
    snippet-file-name.md:otherSnippetName
    --8<--
    ```
   
    When including a single snippet, you can also use the single-line syntax:

    ```text
    --8<-- "snippet-file-name.md:snippetName"
    ```

The content reuse feature is powered by the `pymdownx.snippets` extension, which is enabled and configured in
`mkdocs.yml` under `plugins`. For more information, see the extension [documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/).

### Docs Code Samples Verification

To ensure code samples in documentation are compilable and up-to-date with the latest framework version, the [kotlinx-knit](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-knit) library is used.

Knit provides a Gradle plugin that extracts specially annotated Kotlin code samples from Markdown files and generates Kotlin source files.

#### How to fix code samples in the docs?

1. Run `:docs:knitAssemble` task to clean old knit-generated files, extract fresh code samples to **/src/main/kotlin**, and assemble the docs project:
    ```
    ./gradlew :docs:knitAssemble
    ```
2. Navigate to the file with the compilation error `example-[md-file-name]-[index].kt`.
3. Fix the error in this file.
4. Navigate to the code sample in Markdown `md-file-name.md` by searching `<!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-[index].kt` -->`.
5. Update the code sample to reflect the changes in ***.kt** file:
   * Update dependencies (usually they are provided in the `<!--- INCLUDE -->` section).
   * Edit code (do not forget about tabulation when you just copy and paste from the ***.kt** file).

#### How to annotate code samples in the docs?

To annotate new Kotlin code samples in Markdown and make them compilable:

1. Put an example annotation comment (`<!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-01.kt -->`) after every code block. 
You do not need to put correct indexes, just set the `01` for each example,
   and they will be updated automatically after the first knit run.
    ```
        ```kotlin
        val agent = AIAgent(...)
        ```
        <!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-01.kt -->
    ```
2. If you need some imports, add the include comment `<!--- INCLUDE ... -->` before the code block:
    ```
        <!--- INCLUDE
        import ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent
        -->
        ```kotlin
        val agent = AIAgent(...)
        ```
        <!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-01.kt -->
    ```
3. If you need to wrap your code with `main` or other functions, 
use the include comment `<!--- INCLUDE ... -->` for prefix, and the suffix comment `<!--- SUFFIX ... -->` for suffix:
    ```
        <!--- INCLUDE
        import ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent
        fun main() {
        -->
        <!--- SUFFIX
        }
        -->
        ```kotlin
        val agent = AIAgent(...)
        ```
        <!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-01.kt -->
    ```

For more information, follow the examples in the [kotlinx-knit](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-knit) repository or refer to already annotated code samples in the documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If your documentation contains instructions with code samples,
> use manual numbering (for example, `1) 2) 3)`) instead of Markdown built-in numbered lists.
> This ensures compatibility with the KNIT tool, as KNIT annotations must remain unindented (starting at column 0) and cannot be nested within numbered Markdown lists.
>
> Here is an example:
> ``````markdown
> 1) Step description for the first acti
> on:
> 
> <!--- INCLUDE
> import ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent -->
> ```kotlin
> // Code snippet
> ```
> <!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-01.kt -->
> 
> 2) Step description for the second action:
> 
> <!--- INCLUDE
> import ai.koog.agents.core.agent.AIAgent
> fun main() {
> -->
> <!--- SUFFIX
> }
> -->
> ```kotlin
> // Another code snippet
> ```
> <!--- KNIT example-[md-file-name]-02.kt -->
> ``````

### API Documentation

API reference documentation is generated using [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka), a documentation engine for Kotlin. The API documentation is built with:

```
./gradlew dokkaGenerate
```

The generated API documentation is deployed to [https://api.koog.ai/](https://api.koog.ai/).

#### Links to API documentation

Koog documentation also supports custom API reference link processing that lets you link to specific elements of the
Dokka-generated API reference hosted at [api.koog.ai](https://api.koog.ai). This lets you use the element's FQDN to link
to its API reference page, instead of having to manually provide the full link.

To add an API reference link, use the following link format:

```markdown
[Link text](api:module-name::package-name.declaration)
```

Here is an example of an actual link to the `Tokenizer` interface:

```markdown
[Tokenizer](api:prompt-tokenizer::ai.koog.prompt.tokenizer.Tokenizer)
```

Once processed by mkdocs, the link should render as a regular link to the API reference page.

!!! note
The processor will only render links that already exist in the API reference. Links to locally generated Dokka API reference pages that are not yet available on [api.koog.ai](https://api.koog.ai) will not be processed.

## Prompts

In the [prompt](./prompt) directory, prompting guidelines with extensions for popular modules are stored. These guidelines help users create effective prompts for different LLM models and use cases.
