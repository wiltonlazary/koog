## Introduction

AIAgent features provide a way to extend and enhance the functionality of AI agents. Features can:

- Add new capabilities to agents
- Intercept and modify agent behavior
- Provide access to external systems and resources
- Log and monitor agent execution

Features are designed to be modular and composable, allowing you to mix and match them according to your needs.

## Installing Features

Features are installed when creating a AIAgent instance using the `install` method in the agent constructor:

```kotlin
val agent = AIAgent(
    localEngine = localEngine,
    toolRegistry = toolRegistry,
    strategy = strategy,
    agentConfig = agentConfig
) {
    // Install features here
    install(MyFeature) {
        // Configure the feature
        someProperty = "value"
    }

    install(AnotherFeature) {
        // Configure another feature
        anotherProperty = 42
    }

    // Install a feature with FeatureMessageProcessor
    install(TraceFeature) {
        // Configure the feature
        someProperty = "value"
        // Add message processor
        addMessageProcessor(myFeatureMessageProcessor)
    }
}
```

## Filtering agent events with setEventFilter

In addition to per-processor message filtering, you can filter which agent events a feature will handle using FeatureConfig.setEventFilter. This filter works for any feature and is evaluated before events are passed to any FeatureMessageProcessor.

Key points:
- The predicate receives an EventHandlerContext and must return true to let the event be handled; false will skip it.
- EventHandlerContext exposes eventType and has useful subtypes you can match on (e.g., LLMEventHandlerContext, NodeEventHandlerContext, ToolEventHandlerContext, StrategyEventHandlerContext).
- If you do not set a filter, all events are allowed (default behavior).
- You can change the filter at runtime by calling setEventFilter again; the new predicate is applied to subsequent events.
- This event-level filter composes with per-processor setMessageFilter. Both must allow the item for it to be processed and emitted.

### Disabling event filtering for a feature

Some features rely on receiving the complete sequence of agent lifecycle events to function correctly. For such features, the `setEventFilter` method can be overridden in the feature's configuration class to prevent event filtering.

To disable event filtering for a custom feature:

```kotlin
class MyFeatureConfig : FeatureConfig() {
    override fun setEventFilter(filter: (AgentLifecycleEventContext) -> Boolean) {
        // Log a warning and ignore the filter
        logger.warn { "Events filtering is not allowed for MyFeature." }
        // Always allow all events
        super.setEventFilter { true }
    }
}
```

This pattern is used by features like OpenTelemetry and Debugger, which depend on the execution flow and event hierarchy to produce correct spans and debugging information.

Example: allow only LLM call start/end events for a feature
```kotlin
install(TraceFeature) {
    setEventFilter { context ->
        context.eventType is AgentEventType.BeforeLLMCall ||
            context.eventType is AgentEventType.AfterLLMCall
    }
}
```

Equivalent using context type checks
```kotlin

install(TraceFeature) {
    setEventFilter { context -> context is LLMEventHandlerContext }
}
```

Example: filter node-related events by node name
```kotlin

install(MyFeature) {
    setEventFilter { context ->
        when (context) {
            is NodeBeforeExecuteContext -> context.node.name == "Summarize"
            is NodeAfterExecuteContext -> context.node.name == "Summarize"
            is NodeExecutionErrorContext -> context.node.name == "Summarize"
            else -> true // allow all other event types
        }
    }
}
```

Example: combine setEventFilter with per-processor setMessageFilter
```kotlin
val logWriter = MyFeatureMessageLogWriter(targetLogger = KotlinLogger.logger("my.feature.logger")).apply {
    initialize()
    setMessageFilter { message ->
        // Only log AfterLLMCall messages
        message is LLMCallCompletedEvent
    }
}

install(TraceFeature) {
    // Only allow LLM events for this feature instance
    setEventFilter { context -> 
        context.eventType is AgentEventType.BeforeLLMCall || 
            context.eventType is AgentEventType.AfterLLMCall 
    }

    // Then add a processor with its own, more granular, message filter
    addMessageProcessor(logWriter)
}
```

### Using FeatureMessageProcessor

You can provide a list of `FeatureMessageProcessor` implementations when configuring a feature. These processors can be accessed by the feature configuration. A configuration class should inherit from `FeatureConfig` class to get access to the `messageProcessor` property:
```kotlin
class MyFeatureConfig() : FeatureConfig() { }
```

To install a feature message processor, you can use the `addMessageProcessor()` method on a feature configuration step:
```kotlin
// Create a FeatureMessageProcessor implementation
val myFeatureMessageProcessor = object : FeatureMessageProcessor {
    override suspend fun processMessage(message: FeatureMessage) {
        // Handle feature messages
        println("Received message: $message")
    }
}

// Install a feature with the FeatureMessageProcessor
install(TraceFeature) {
    // Configure the feature
    addMessageProcessor(myFeatureMessageProcessor)
}
```

The `FeatureMessageProcessor` class contains methods for initialization of a concrete processor instance and properly closing it when finished.

#### Filtering messages with setMessageFilter

Every `FeatureMessageProcessor` now supports message filtering via `setMessageFilter`. By default, all messages are processed. You can supply a predicate to process only specific messages. The filter is evaluated for each incoming `FeatureMessage` before it is passed to the processor.

Example: only process LLM call start/end events
```kotlin
myFeatureMessageProcessor.setMessageFilter { message ->
    message is LLMCallStartingEvent ||
    message is LLMCallCompletedEvent
}
```

You can use the same approach with any concrete processor implementation (e.g., `FeatureMessageLogWriter`, `FeatureMessageFileWriter`, or `FeatureMessageRemoteWriter`):
```kotlin
val logWriter = MyFeatureMessageLogWriter(targetLogger = KotlinLogger.logger("my.feature.logger"))
logWriter.initialize()
logWriter.setMessageFilter { message -> 
    message is LLMCallCompletedEvent && message.content.contains("keyword")
}

install(MyFeature) {
    addMessageProcessor(logWriter)
}
```

Notes:
- If you do not set a filter, all messages are processed (default behavior).
- You can change the filter at runtime by calling `setMessageFilter` again; the new predicate will be applied to subsequent messages.

### Using FeatureMessageFileWriter

For more advanced message processing, you can use `FeatureMessageFileWriter` to write feature messages to files. This abstract class provides functionality to convert and write feature messages to a target file using a specified file system provider.

```kotlin
// Create a custom implementation of FeatureMessageFileWriter
class MyFeatureMessageFileWriter<Path>(
    fs: FileSystemProvider.ReadWrite<Path>,
    root: Path,
    append: Boolean = false
) : FeatureMessageFileWriter<Path>(fs, root, append) {
    // Implement the required method to convert a FeatureMessage to a string
    override fun FeatureMessage.toFileString(): String {
        return "Custom format: ${this.messageType.value} - ${this.toString()}"
    }
}

// Create an instance and use it with a feature
val fileWriter = MyFeatureMessageFileWriter(
    sinkOpener = JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite::sink,
    targetPath = Path("/path/to/logs/main.log"),
)

// Initialize the writer before use
fileWriter.initialize()

// Use the writer with a feature
install(TraceFeature) {
    // Add the file writer as a message processor
    addMessageProcessor(fileWriter)
}
```

The `FeatureMessageFileWriter` takes the following parameters:
- `fs`: The file system provider used to interact with the file system
- `root`: The directory root or file path where messages will be written
- `append`: Whether to append to an existing file or overwrite it (defaults to `false`)

If `root` is a directory, a new file will be created with a timestamp-based name. If `root` is an existing file, messages will be written to that file.

You must implement the abstract method `FeatureMessage.toFileString()` to define how feature messages are converted to strings for file output.

The writer handles thread safety, file path resolution, and proper resource management. Remember to call `initialize()` before using the writer and `close()` when you're done with it.

## Message Processors

The AIAgent features framework provides several message processor implementations that can be used to process feature messages in different ways. These processors can be added to a feature configuration using the `addMessageProcessor` method from the `FeatureConfig` class.

### Using FeatureMessageLogWriter

The `FeatureMessageLogWriter` is a message processor that logs feature messages to a provided logger instance. It's useful for debugging and monitoring feature activity.

```kotlin
// Create a custom implementation of FeatureMessageLogWriter
class MyFeatureMessageLogWriter(
    logger: KLogger
) : FeatureMessageLogWriter(logger) {
    // Implement the required method to convert a FeatureMessage to a string
    override fun FeatureMessage.toLoggerMessage(): String {
        return "Custom log format: ${this.messageType.value} - ${this.toString()}"
    }
}

// Create an instance and use it with a feature
val logWriter = MyFeatureMessageLogWriter(
    targetLogger = KotlinLogger.logger("my.feature.logger")
)

// Initialize the writer before use
logWriter.initialize()

// Use the writer with a feature
install(MyFeature) {
    // Add the log writer as a message processor
    addMessageProcessor(logWriter)
}
```

### Using FeatureMessageFileWriter

The `FeatureMessageFileWriter` is a message processor that writes feature messages to a file using a specified file system provider. It's useful for persistent logging and data collection.

```kotlin
// Create a custom implementation of FeatureMessageFileWriter
class MyFeatureMessageFileWriter<Path>(
    fs: FileSystemProvider.ReadWrite<Path>,
    root: Path,
    append: Boolean = false
) : FeatureMessageFileWriter<Path>(fs, root, append) {
    // Implement the required method to convert a FeatureMessage to a string
    override fun FeatureMessage.toFileString(): String {
        return "Custom format: ${this.messageType.value} - ${this.toString()}"
    }
}

// Create an instance and use it with a feature
val fileWriter = MyFeatureMessageFileWriter(
    sinkOpener = JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite::sink,
    targetPath = Path("/path/to/logs/main.log"),
)

// Initialize the writer before use
fileWriter.initialize()

// Use the writer with a feature
install(MyFeature) {
    // Add the file writer as a message processor
    addMessageProcessor(fileWriter)
}
```

### Using FeatureMessageRemoteWriter

The `FeatureMessageRemoteWriter` is a message processor that facilitates writing feature messages to a remote server. It's useful for distributed systems and remote monitoring.

```kotlin
// Create a custom implementation of FeatureMessageRemoteWriter
class MyFeatureMessageRemoteWriter(
    connectionConfig: ServerConnectionConfig? = null
) : FeatureMessageRemoteWriter(connectionConfig) {
    // You can override methods to customize behavior if needed
}

// Create an instance with custom server configuration
val remoteWriter = MyFeatureMessageRemoteWriter(
    connectionConfig = ServerConnectionConfig(
        host = "localhost",
        port = 9090
    )
)

// Initialize the writer before use
remoteWriter.initialize()

// Use the writer with a feature
install(MyFeature) {
    // Add the remote writer as a message processor
    addMessageProcessor(remoteWriter)
}
```

The `FeatureMessageRemoteWriter` takes an optional `ServerConnectionConfig` parameter that specifies the host and port for the remote server. If not provided, it uses a default configuration with port 50881.

## Configuring Features

Each feature has its own configuration options that can be set in the installation block. The configuration options are defined by the feature's `Config` class.

```kotlin
install(MyFeature) {
    // 'this' is the Config instance
    someProperty = "value"
    anotherProperty = 42

    // You can also use conditional configuration
    if (someCondition) {
        optionalProperty = "optional value"
    }
}
```

## Implementing Custom Features

### Multiple Handlers for the Same Event

Features can register multiple handlers for the same event type. All handlers will be called in the order they were registered:

```kotlin
override fun install(config: Config, pipeline: AIAgentGraphPipeline): MyFeature {
    val feature = MyFeature()

    // Register multiple handlers for the same event
    pipeline.interceptAgentStarting(this) { eventContext ->
        feature.logger.info("Handler 1: Agent starting")
    }

    pipeline.interceptAgentStarting(this) { eventContext ->
        feature.logger.info("Handler 2: Agent starting")
    }

    // Both handlers will be called in order when the agent starts
    return feature
}
```

This is particularly useful when you need to perform multiple independent operations in response to the same event.

### Basic Feature Structure

To implement a custom feature, you need to:

1. Create a feature class
2. Define a configuration class
3. Create a companion object that implements `AIAgentFeature`
4. Implement the required methods

Here's a basic example:

```kotlin
class MyFeature(val someProperty: String) {
    // Configuration class
    class Config {
        var someProperty: String = "default"
    }

    // Feature definition
    companion object Feature : AIAgentFeature<Config, MyFeature> {
        // Unique key for the feature
        override val key = createStorageKey<MyFeature>("my-feature")

        // Create default configuration
        override fun createInitialConfig(): Config = Config()

        // Install the feature
        override fun install(config: Config, pipeline: AIAgentPipeline) {
            // Create feature instance
            val feature = MyFeature(config.someProperty)

            // Make the feature available in stage contexts
            pipeline.installToStageContext(this) { context ->
                feature
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Pipeline Interceptors

Features can intercept various points in the agent execution pipeline:

1. **Stage Context Installation**: Make the feature available in stage contexts
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.installToStageContext(this) { context ->
       MyFeature(config.someProperty)
   }
   ```

2. **Context Agent Feature Interception**: Customize how features are provided to agent contexts
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptContextAgentFeature(MyFeature) { agentContext ->
       // Inspect agent context and return a feature instance
       MyFeature(customizedForStage = agentContext.stageName)
   }
   ```

3. **Environment Transformation**: Transform the agent environment when it's created
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptEnvironmentCreated(this) { eventContext, environment ->
       // Wrap or modify the environment
       MyCustomEnvironment(delegate = environment)
   }
   ```

   Multiple environment transformers can be registered and will be applied in order, with each transformer receiving the result of the previous one.

4. **Agent Starting Interception**: Execute code when an agent starts
   ```kotlin
   val interceptContext = InterceptContext(this, feature)
   pipeline.interceptAgentStarting(interceptContext) { event ->
       // Access agent, runId, context, or feature
       // event.agent, event.runId, event.context, event.feature
   }
   ```

5. **Strategy Starting Interception**: Execute code when a strategy starts
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptStrategyStarting(interceptContext) { event ->
       // Inspect agent or context when strategy starts
   }
   ```

6. **Before Node Execution**: Execute code before a node runs
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptNodeExecutionStarting(interceptContext) { event ->
       logger.info("Node ${event.node.name} is about to execute with input: ${event.input}")
   }
   ```

7. **After Node Execution**: Execute code after a node completes
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptNodeExecutionCompleted(interceptContext) { event ->
       logger.info("Node ${event.node.name} executed with input: ${event.input} and produced output: ${event.output}")
   }
   ```

8. **LLM Call Starting**: Execute code before a call to the language model
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptLLMCallStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
       logger.info("About to make LLM call with prompt: ${eventContext.prompt.messages.last().content}")
   }
   ```

9. **LLM Call Starting (with tools)**: Tools are available via the event context
   ```kotlin
   pipeline.interceptLLMCallStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
       logger.info("About to make LLM call with ${eventContext.tools.size} tools")
   }
   ```

10. **LLM Call Completed**: Execute code after a call to the language model
    ```kotlin
    pipeline.interceptLLMCallCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
        logger.info("Received LLM responses: ${eventContext.responses}")
    }
    ```

11. **LLM Call Completed (with tools)**: Access responses and tools via the event context
    ```kotlin
    pipeline.interceptLLMCallCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
        logger.info("Received ${eventContext.responses.size} responses (tools used: ${eventContext.tools.size})")
    }
    ```

12. **Subgraph Execution Starting**: Execute code before a subgraph runs
    ```kotlin
    pipeline.interceptSubgraphExecutionStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
        logger.info("Subgraph ${eventContext.subgraph.name} is about to execute with input: ${eventContext.input}")
    }
    ```

13. **Subgraph Execution Completed**: Execute code after a subgraph completes
    ```kotlin
    pipeline.interceptSubgraphExecutionCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
        logger.info("Subgraph ${eventContext.subgraph.name} executed with input: ${eventContext.input} and produced output: ${eventContext.output}")
    }
    ```

14. **Subgraph Execution Failed**: Handle errors when a subgraph execution fails
    ```kotlin
    pipeline.interceptSubgraphExecutionFailed(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
        logger.error("Subgraph ${eventContext.subgraph.name} execution failed with error: ${eventContext.throwable}")
    }
    ```

### Advanced Interceptors

For more advanced use cases, you can combine multiple interceptors to create complex features. Here's an example of a logging feature:

```kotlin
class LoggingFeature(val logger: Logger) {
    class Config {
        var loggerName: String = "agent-logs"
    }

    companion object Feature: AIAgentFeature<LoggingFeature.Config, LoggingFeature> {
        override val key: AIAgentStorageKey<LoggingFeature> = createStorageKey("logging-feature")

        override fun createInitialConfig(): Config = Config()

        override fun install(
            config: Config,
            pipeline: AIAgentPipeline
        ) {
            val logging = LoggingFeature(LoggerFactory.getLogger(config.loggerName))

            val interceptContext = InterceptContext(this, logging)

            // Intercept agent starting
            pipeline.interceptAgentStarting(interceptContext) { event ->
                event.feature.logger.info("Agent starting: runId=${event.runId}")
            }

            // Intercept strategy starting
            pipeline.interceptStrategyStarting(interceptContext) { event ->
                event.feature.logger.info("Strategy starting")
            }

            // Intercept before node execution
            pipeline.interceptNodeExecutionStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Node ${eventContext.node.name} received input: ${eventContext.input}")
            }

            // Intercept after node execution
            pipeline.interceptNodeExecutionCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Node ${eventContext.node.name} with input: ${eventContext.input} produced output: ${eventContext.output}")
            }

            // Intercept LLM calls
            pipeline.interceptLLMCallStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Making LLM call with prompt: ${eventContext.prompt.messages.lastOrNull()?.content?.take(100)}...")
            }

            pipeline.interceptLLMCallCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Received LLM responses: ${eventContext.responses}")
            }

            // Intercept LLM calls with tools (available via eventContext.tools)
            pipeline.interceptLLMCallStarting(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Making LLM call with ${eventContext.tools.size} tools")
                eventContext.tools.forEach { tool ->
                    logger.info("Tool available: ${tool.name}")
                }
            }

            pipeline.interceptLLMCallCompleted(interceptContext) { eventContext ->
                logger.info("Received ${eventContext.responses.size} response(s)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Available Features

### Debugger

The Debugger feature integrates into an AI agent's pipeline and intercepts various events such as agent start/finish, strategy execution, node execution, LLM calls, and tool operations. These events are collected and can be sent to a remote debugging server for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Key capabilities of the Debugger feature include:
- Monitoring the complete lifecycle of AI agent execution
- Tracking strategy and node executions
- Recording LLM calls and responses
- Logging tool operations and their results
- Capturing errors and exceptions during agent execution
- Connecting to a remote debugging server for real-time monitoring

### Using in your project

To use the Debugger feature in your project, you need to install it when creating an AI agent. The feature can be configured with custom settings or used with default values.

#### Basic Installation

```kotlin
// When creating an agent
val agent = createAgent(
    // ... other agent configuration
) {
    // Install the Debugger feature with default settings
    install(Debugger)
}
```

#### Custom Configuration

You can customize the Debugger by specifying a port and connection timeout for the debugging server:

```kotlin
val agent = createAgent(
    // ... other agent configuration
) {
    install(Debugger) {
        // Set a specific port for the debugging server
        setPort(8080)

        // Set a timeout for waiting for the first connection (optional)
        // If not set, the server will wait indefinitely or use system variables
        setConnectionWaitingTimeout(5.seconds)
    }
}
```

#### Port Configuration Priority

The Debugger feature determines the port to use in the following order:
1. Explicitly set port in the configuration (using `setPort()`)
2. Environment variable `KOOG_DEBUGGER_PORT`
3. JVM option `-Dkoog.debugger.port=<port>`
4. Default Koog remote server port (50881)

#### Connection Timeout Configuration Priority

The Debugger feature determines the connection waiting timeout in the following order:
1. Explicitly set timeout in the configuration (using `setConnectionWaitingTimeout()`)
2. Environment variable `KOOG_DEBUGGER_WAIT_CONNECTION_MS` (value in milliseconds)
3. JVM option `-Dkoog.debugger.wait.connection.ms=<milliseconds>`
4. Default behavior: wait indefinitely for the first connection

#### Testing Debugger Feature

You can test the Debugger feature by creating a client that connects to the debugging server and collects events:

```kotlin
// Server configuration (agent with Debugger)
val port = findAvailablePort()
val agent = createAgent(
    // ... agent configuration
) {
    install(Debugger) {
        setPort(port)
    }
}

// Client configuration
val clientConfig = DefaultClientConnectionConfig(
    host = "127.0.0.1", 
    port = port
)

// Create a client to collect events
FeatureMessageRemoteClient(connectionConfig = clientConfig).use { client ->
    // Collect and verify events
    // ...
    
    // Run the agent
    agent.run(userPrompt)
}
```

### Example of usage

Here's a complete example of using the Debugger feature in a real-world scenario:

```kotlin
// Create a strategy for the agent
val strategy = strategy("example-strategy") {
    val nodeLLMRequest by nodeLLMRequest("llm-request-node")
    val nodeToolCall by nodeExecuteTool("tool-call-node")
    val nodeSendToolResult by nodeLLMSendToolResult("send-tool-result-node")

    edge(nodeStart forwardTo nodeLLMRequest)
    edge(nodeLLMRequest forwardTo nodeToolCall onToolCall { true })
    edge(nodeLLMRequest forwardTo nodeFinish onAssistantMessage { true })
    edge(nodeToolCall forwardTo nodeSendToolResult)
    edge(nodeSendToolResult forwardTo nodeFinish onAssistantMessage { true })
    edge(nodeSendToolResult forwardTo nodeToolCall onToolCall { true })
}

// Create a tool registry
val toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {
    tool(SearchTool())
    tool(CalculatorTool())
}

// Create an agent with the Debugger feature
val agent = createAgent(
    agentId = "example-agent",
    strategy = strategy,
    promptId = "example-prompt",
    systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant.",
    toolRegistry = toolRegistry,
    model = myLLModel
) {
    // Install and configure the Debugger feature
    install(Debugger) {
        // Use a specific port or let it use the default
        // setPort(8080)
    }
}

// Use the agent
agent.use { 
    // Run the agent with a user prompt
    val result = agent.run("Calculate 25 * 16 and then search for information about the result.")
    
    // Process the result
    println("Agent result: $result")
}
```

While the agent is running, the Debugger will collect events such as:
- Agent start and finish events
- Strategy execution events
- Node execution events
- LLM calls and responses
- Tool calls and their results

These events can be monitored through a debugging client connected to the specified port.
