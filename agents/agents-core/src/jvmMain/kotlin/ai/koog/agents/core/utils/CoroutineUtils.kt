 * context and which dispatcher is being used.

 * 1. **Re-entrancy Detection**: Identifying when a blocking call from Java has re-entered the agent system.
 * 2. **Deadlock Prevention**: Ensuring that we don't attempt to synchronously dispatch to a dispatcher

/**
 * Executes a suspending [block] by either using [runBlocking] or immediately executing it if already
 * on the target dispatcher.
 *
 * This function handles the "bridge" between the non-suspending Java API and the suspending internal logic.
 * It uses [AGENT_CONTEXT_ELEMENT] to track the execution state across blocking boundaries.
 *
 * ### Deadlock Prevention Logic:
 * If the current thread is already associated with a [CoroutineContext] (stored in [AGENT_CONTEXT_ELEMENT]):
 * 1. It compares the [targetDispatcher] with the [existingDispatcher].
 * 2. If they match (or [targetDispatcher] is null), it uses `runBlocking(EmptyCoroutineContext)`.
 *    This starts a nested event loop on the **current thread** without trying to reschedule the task
 *    on the dispatcher's executor service. This is vital because the executor might be single-threaded
 *    and currently blocked by the outer `runBlocking` call.
 *
 * If the dispatchers differ, it performs a standard `runBlocking(context)`, which may block the current
 * thread while the block executes on a different thread pool (e.g., switching from Strategy to LLM pool).
 *
 * @param context The coroutine context to use for execution.
 * @param block The suspending block to execute.
 * @return The result of the [block].
